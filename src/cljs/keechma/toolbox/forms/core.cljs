      (fn [value old-value]

    ```
    
    Formatting funtion should have a `format-chars` meta-data entry, which will be used to correctly position the cursor after formatting. Formatting function should be able to take in the formatted data, extract the value and format the data again. It should also handle corner cases like `nil` or empty string.
